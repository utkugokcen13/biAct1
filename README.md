## Project Description
_In Bilkent University, there are a few places that we can see the announcements of club events such as BAIS, STARS, and wallpapers. However, students don’t like reading such a tedious list of activities through BAIS mails or STARS. They can only see these activities on wall announcements in certain department buildings here and almost every time they do not even read these announcements. Therefore, students can miss events and may not complete GE250/1 points. Besides, they may not do their interested out-lesson activities, so they may not learn any skills except their major lessons and they are not enjoyed in university. Thus, it would be better if students read these activities from their phones without having to log in to their STARS or mail accounts. We are developing the mobile app named BiAct that shows upcoming activities, seminars from wanted clubs and departments lists. The target aim of this app is to provide a more easily tracked list of events such as seminars, club activities and researches, in Bilkent University created by clubs, departments with making the environment where users can interact with each other. We are expecting that this app is used by all Bilkent University students._
